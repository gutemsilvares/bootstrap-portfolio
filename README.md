# Portfolio - My Portfolio Bootstrap Template

This is a solution to the Portfolio landing page challenge on Bootcamp University of Birmingham Front End & UX]. The challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the layout responsive for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for the interactive elements on the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Bootstrap
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Bootstrap
- CSS Grid Bootstrap
- Mobile-first web design
- Desktop Design
- Smoth scrolling
- Google Fonts - Style components

### What I learned

My Portfolio gave more understanding about using together Flexbox and CSS Grid, I recap over some of learnings while I was working through this project and a great way to reinforce mine own knowledge.

### Continued development

I'm still working on Bootstrap using new templates and working on it. I want to continue focusing on my future projects.
